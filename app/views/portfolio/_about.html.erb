<main class="about-main">
<p> Hi,<br> I'm Kito and I'm a budding developer.<br><br> My focus is on becoming a full stack developer as I am passionate about design and asthetics but believe in functionality and wan't to cultivate a more technically minded approach.<br><br> I enrolled in a coding bootcamp in February 2018 without realising the grip that programming would take on my life. I wasn't so sure it would be for me, but when I sat down for my first class and learnt a single line of Ruby code I was instantly hooked. If I could inject code into my arms I would... o_0.<br><br> I grew up in Byron Bay (I swear I don't smell... too much...) where I was instilled with an alternative perception on life so I believe in environment and sustainabilty firmly. I am motivated to make a change in the way we do things and I think that technology is the pathway in which I can achieve this. </p>
